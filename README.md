# nowatermarks
simple vita plugin to remove watermarks from screenshots

I edited YifanLu's screenshot sample from [here](https://github.com/yifanlu/taiHEN/blob/master/USAGE.md#advanced-usage) to replace sceScreenshotOverlayImage with an empty function as suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/624902/getting_rid_of_screenshot_watermarks/dfjofc1/)

I can't guarantee that this is working yet, since my C knowledge is extremely limited and I didn't test it yet.
